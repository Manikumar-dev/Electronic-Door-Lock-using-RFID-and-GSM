With the rising interest in security, frameworks with high reliability and fast response times are essential for industries and enterprises. Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of the most significant areas of future development and is gaining substantial attention from both the scientific community and industry. In this work, an RFID-based door access control system using Arduino is developed. The system utilizes RFID ID tags and an RFID reader to compare the scanned tag data with the stored data in the microcontroller. Based on the validation, the door is operated using a servo motor or solenoid lock mechanism.

With the rising interest in security, frameworks with high reliability and fast response times are essential for industries and enterprises. Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) is one of the most significant areas of future development and is gaining substantial attention from both the scientific community and industry. In this work, an RFID-based door access control system using Arduino is developed. The system utilizes RFID ID tags and an RFID reader to compare the scanned tag data with the stored data in the microcontroller. Based on the validation, the door is operated using a servo motor or solenoid lock mechanism.

When a user scans their RFID tag on the reader, the microcontroller checks whether the card is registered. If it is valid, the system unlocks the door via the relay and solenoid lock, allowing access. If the tag is unrecognized, the system activates a buzzer as a security alert and sends an SMS notification via the GSM module to a predefined mobile number, alerting the concerned authority of the unauthorized access attempt. The relay functions as a switch to lock or unlock the door. The entire process is managed by an Arduino program written in embedded C.

Main objective of this project:

• To lock/unlock the door using RFID technology.

• This system gives a buzzer if an unauthorized person tries to access the door.

• Relay-based switching mechanism.

• Using Arduino to achieve this task.

The main building blocks of the project are:

• Arduino microcontroller.
• Adapter power supply.
• RFID reader.
• Relay.
• Solenoid lock.
• GSM.
• Buzzer.

Software used:
1. Arduino IDE for compiling and dumping code into the controller
2. Express SCH for Circuit design.
